Picking Throughput: This KPI measures the speed at which associates are picking items. To calculate picking throughput, you'll need to gather data on the number of items picked per unit of time, typically per hour or day. You can use Manhattan WMS to extract data on the number of items picked and the time it takes to pick them.

Number of Cartons Packed: This KPI measures the number of cartons that associates pack during a shift. You can gather data on this by using Zebra Hip printers used to print PTS labels. The system logs will contain information on the number of cartons that were packed.

Accuracy of Packed Cartons: This KPI measures the accuracy of associates' packing. You can gather data on this by scanning the PTS labels at the end of the packing process to verify that the contents match the order. You can also use the Honeywell Vocollect technology to access system logs that track the number of errors made by associates during the packing process.

To aggregate the WMS data, you can use SQL queries to extract the relevant information and store it in a database. You can then use a tool like Excel or Python to transform and clean the data as needed. For example, you might need to convert timestamps to a more readable format, remove duplicates, or fill in missing data.

To gather data from the Honeywell Vocollect technology, you'll need to access the system logs. You can do this by logging into the system and exporting the relevant data. Once you have the data, you can use a tool like Excel or Python to clean and transform it as needed.

To gather data from the Zebra Hip printers, you can print out queues of the PTS labels that were printed during a given period. You can then use a barcode scanner to scan the labels and gather data on the number of cartons that were packed.

When tracking picking throughput broken down by dispatch or wave, you'll need to ensure that the data is tagged appropriately. You can do this by using the dispatch or wave number as a tag in the data. You can then use a visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI to create a dashboard that displays the KPIs broken down by dispatch or wave.

In summary, determining the appropriate KPIs for tracking associates' productivity and accuracy in the "Put to Store" process requires gathering data from different sources, including Manhattan WMS, Honeywell Vocollect technology, and Zebra Hip printers. You can aggregate and transform the data using SQL queries and tools like Excel or Python. When visualizing the data, you can break it down by hourly, daily, or by dispatch or wave to get a more detailed picture of associates' performance.
